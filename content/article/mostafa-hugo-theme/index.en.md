I was searching for a simple Hugo theme that supports various content types, multilingual content, RTL and responsive layout for my website/blog, but none of the available options had all the features I needed. So, I decided to build my own theme to ensure it had all the features I required. The result is **Mostafa Hugo Theme**, a theme that now powers my blog.

## Flexible Design for Various Content

One of the standout features of this theme is its support for various content types. Unlike many other themes that focus only on text-based articles, **Mostafa Hugo Theme** enables publishing different types of content, including:

- **Articles**: Classic text-based blog posts.
- **Videos**: Embed videos from platforms like YouTube, Vimeo or host them directly.
- **Audio**: Perfect for podcasts or any kind of audio content.
- **Gallery**: Showcase images in a slideshow as a gallery.
- **Status**: Share quick updates or short-form content similar to social media posts.
- **Links**: Share external resources with a brief description.

## Multilingual and RTL Support

One of my main requirements was the ability to write some posts in multiple languages. **Mostafa Hugo Theme** fully supports multilingual blogs, allowing content to be written in different languages seamlessly. This feature ensures that readers can easily switch between languages and access content in their preferred language.

Additionally, when exploring other themes, I noticed that most of them did not support **RTL (Right-to-Left) languages** like Persian. This was another major reason that motivated me to create my own theme. **Mostafa Hugo Theme** provides full RTL support, making it a great choice for Persian, Arabic, and other RTL language users.

## Other Key Features

- Responsive design
- Supports various content types
- Multilingual support
- RTL support
- Dark and modern theme
- Integrated with social media
- Customizable Layouts

## Why this name?

The name is quite simple: I originally built this theme for myself, so it carries my name. It is based on Hugo, the static site generator, and ultimately, it is a themeâ€”hence, **Mostafa Hugo Theme**.
