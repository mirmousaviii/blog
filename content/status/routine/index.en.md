One of the most important things I've learned in life is that routine and discipline are like the pillars of a house; without them, you might stay standing for a while, but sooner or later, you'll collapse. They save you on tough days and help you grow on good ones. They may seem boring, but they are what keep your mind balanced and at peace, helping you stay on track and keep moving forward even in the hardest times.
